Key Insights (Bullet Points)

Daily ride demand is highly stable, with 3200–3400 bookings per day, indicating predictable customer behavior and strong platform consistency.

Cancellation rate is high at 28%, driven mainly by driver behavior and operational inefficiencies—far above the industry benchmark (<10%).

Driver-related cancellations dominate, with 18K cancellations, including major issues like drivers not moving toward pickup and asking customers to cancel.

“Driver Not Found” occurred 10K times, highlighting a major gap in driver availability, allocation logic, or location-based shortages.

Prime Sedan is the top-performing vehicle type, generating the highest booking value, most successful rides, and longest total distance traveled.

Cash remains the largest revenue source, showing customer reliance on offline payments despite available digital options.

UPI is the most adopted digital method, contributing significantly but still trailing behind cash, while card payments remain minimal.

High-value customers (₹6000–₹8000 spend range) form a strong premium segment; CID785112 is the highest contributor at ₹8025.

Driver ratings are highest for Prime SUV and E-Bike (4.01), while customer ratings peak with Prime Plus users, showing vehicle-type-driven satisfaction differences.

Daily ride distance follows a stable pattern, with occasional spikes (July 30) and drops (July 31), possibly driven by surge demand or operational disruptions.
